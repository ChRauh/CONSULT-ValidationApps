Within a competitive environment, the cement industry can bring a unique contribution to increased energy- and resource efficiency through constant improvement of its manufacturing processes and increased use of alternative fuels and raw materials. The durability, resilience and strength of its downstream product, concrete, allows the sector to respond to society's challenges by providing energy-efficient, affordable housing and infrastructure for a growing population.

In addition, the cement industry has replaced part of its traditional fuel sources with biomass and waste, with alternative fuels accounting for 41% of its fuel requirements.

As a result, it needs a predictable legal framework in order to ensure continued investment and job creation in europe, as well as a high environmental performance.

Deutsches aktieninstitut therefore welcomes the initiative of the eu commission to improve the benchmark regulation (bmr), on two key points: (1) the exemption of specific foreign exchange benchmarks and (2) the introduction of statutory replacements for discontinued or unrepresentative financial benchmarks. The proposed amendments are both a step in the right direction, although from the perspective of nfcs they both require further refinement and extension. In particular, the proposal to exempt certain non-eu-benchmarks should be extended to other classes of benchmarks (most notably interest rate benchmarks). However, the proposal has missed the opportunity for a comprehensive reform of the bmr. Just as other jurisdictions have limited their regulatory regimes to the most critical or systemic benchmarks, the bmr should employ a risked based approach and focus its efforts on critical benchmarks only. This would solve a number of problems that currently arise with the bmr without jeopardizing the ultimate objective of ensuring reliability of financial benchmarks and protecting the eu economy from systemic risks.

For example, even with good staff, good dogs and good weather, only 90% of a flock may be gathered. Moreover, if a gathered animal has lost all of its tags (whether single or double-tagged) it will often be impossible to confirm its specific identify. 8.

One of the first issues is about reporting on transactional events information on the unique identifiers, that is a very complex issue due to the nature of tobacco manufacturing. Namely, it is not possible to create a link between unique identifier and the purchase order because the practice of the tobacco industry is to operate on a make to stock model under which stocks are reloaded automatically at a given level, from which an order can be made at a later time. As a result, production happens even if an order has not been placed yet, making the link between unique identifier and the purchase order impossible. Same applies about linking the unique identifier with payment records and invoice. In this case, payments are managed on a customer credit basis that is dependent on the number of sales during a given period and up to a specific credit limit.

"F14261","For the members of erpa*, the volumes produced represent more than 400 million colored chickens per year. To help the development of rural poultry, farmers need small or medium-sized slaughterhouses, spread throughout the territory. This is important to guarantee that the poultry is locally produced and to limit unnecessary transport of live animals, in a context of strong consumer demands for local products and animal welfare. Nevertheless, the permanent presence of official veterinarians in slaughterhouses is an important obstacle to the development of small/medium slaughterhouses. Indeed, this could disturb the functioning of small slaughterhouses because of the low availability of official veterinarians and the expensive costs that the controls represent. In countries where these structures are not allowed, illegal slaughtering is developing, sometimes reaching large volumes, and this situation should absolutely be avoided. That is why we ask for flexibility regarding the daily presence of official veterinarians in law capacity slaughterhouses.

In our view, in its assessment of the market impact of the liner ber the commission has not duly considered the range of effects on the supply chain as a whole. When assessing the market, the commission has structurally limited the view on one particular service in the market, unduly neglecting the fact that sea transport hardly ever is offered as an isolated service on a segregated sea transport market but necessarily and per se is embedded into an often world-wide and interlinked chain of services providers, forged by a variety of commercial stakeholders, infrastructure providers and even national states (the market).",6.60107584505427,0.261802575107296,0.857142857142857,16.3588461538462,FALSE

Specifically, we suggest adding the following wording as article 9 (c): the offender acts in order to safeguard fundamental eu values included in the treaty on european union and the treaty on the functioning of the european union. The aim of extending the scope of mitigating circumstances is to ensure that in exceptional situations there is a possibility to properly reconcile different values, i. e protection of the environment and fundamental eu values. The proposed additional category of mitigating circumstances could matter, for instance, in situations of energy supply disruptions that would put life and health of eu citizens at risk. In such case the disruptions could occur due to a decision of a supplier (e. g. foreign supplier during energy crisis) or because of technical failure of installations.

Because of the rural location of sugar factories and limited access to high-voltage grids, full electrification is neither a cost-effective nor even feasible decarbonisation pathway for our sector.

"F514132","In this regard, aena welcomes this public consultation and is very pleased to contribute. Aena is aware about the need to move towards a carbon neutral society and we consider that airports can play an important role in supporting the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Itas clear that this transition to climate neutrality requires changes not only across the political spectrum but also the collective effort of all sectors of the economy and society. For this reason aena want to be part of this debate by working together with the european commisison, policymakers and other stakeholders in order to reach a carbon neutral sector. Consequently, aena considers that to achieve more ambitious decarbonization objectives it is necessary to invest in the development of new technologies. Moreover, we consider that investments on innovation should be considered for the aviation sector to promote and guarantee the supply biofuels or alternative fuels for aviation at european airports. In addition, the development of other technologies such as electric propulsion would be beneficial to the sector's contributions to carbon emission reductions. These must be incentivized economically to achieve the expected results in the shortest period of time. Aena is committed to support europeas ambition to become the first climate-neutral continent and we look forward to contributing to this policy development process.",6.61017256926981,0.175115207373272,0.555555555555556,17.8405632360471,FALSE
"F12917","We attach to our feedback a document in which we express our critical position towards this proposal which in our opinion does not solve the marine litter problem. Background according to independent studies, global marine litter is mainly generated by asian countries. China, indonesia, the philippines, thailand and vietnam are among the top 10 countries creating ocean plastic waste, with europe recognized as a leader in waste management, including plastics. Mismanagement of waste is considered the main cause of food containers, bottles and glasses being released into the marine environment, which is why the eu recently completed its review of waste legislation, increasing recycling targets and establishing a new policy on waste and waste prevention, which is intended to solve many negative externalities of plastics. Violation of the single market and violation of the principle of proportionality the proposal violates the principle of the eu single market by allowing european member states to restrict certain categories of products (see article 5 of the proposal), thus fragmenting the european market. Furthermore, choosing a directive as a legislative tool to address the issue is not helpful, as confirmed by the european commission's regulatory scrutiny board. The implementation of the plastic bags directive continues to demonstrate that a directive creates wide differences between member states, undermining the harmonization of standards and products.",6.61609132911919,0.237442922374429,1.85714285714286,12.0608219178083,TRUE
