Indeed there clearly exists a need for a more aligned and contiguous evidence base for effective eu governance and increased cross directorate heterogenous policy implementation, including (dg env, dg sante, dg chafea, dg agri, dg devco, dg clima, dg ener, dg echo, dg epsc, dg ercea, and dg connect) especially related to e-prtr regulation, drinking water directive, persistent organic pollutants, atmospheric concentration of co2, ocean acidification (hydrogen ion concentration nmol/kg), fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), deforestation, soil degradation, etc all of which conspire to further reduce the planet’s capacity to sustain the growing human population. Further the anthropocene provenance of the degradation of the environment specifically related to air, water, and land, combined with a significant loss in biodiversity, have resulted in substantial health impacts, including, a seismic increase in chronic diseases, the reduction of food security and nutrition, loss of freshwater resources, higher exposure to communicable disease and increase of non-communicable disease and increased loss of life and well-being by extreme weather events.
