"F2750997","We appreciate this important initiative to the amendment of the regulation setting co2 emission standards for cars and vans.

The revised co2 standards will also contribute to modernize and make the automotive value chain more sustainable. Accounting for tank-to-wheel emissions fails to recognize and therefore incentivize better fuels with lower well-to-tank performance and biogenic energy content. This should be corrected, as better fuels provide benefits in the context of both new and existing vehicles.

Gleif will focus its comments on the use of the legal entity identifier (lei) in the document. First some background on the lei. The development of a system to uniquely identify legal entities globally had its beginnings in the 2008 financial crisis. Regulators worldwide acknowledged their inability to identify parties to transactions across markets, products, and regions for regulatory reporting and supervision. This hindered the ability to evaluate systemic and emerging risk, to identify trends, and to take corrective steps. Recognizing this gap, authorities, working with the private sector, have developed the framework of a global lei system (gleis) that will, through the issuance of unique leis, unambiguously identify legal entities engaged in financial transactions.

"F2750875","Although it has been so far often communicated that in order to achieve the increased 2030 climate target and the climate neutrality by 2050 objective, it will be necessary to sequester more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, how exactly this will be accomplished still remains very unclear. While eustafor supports higher climate ambition, any future scenario of strengthening lulucf in order to be in line with the climate objectives will be beneficial only if the emitting sectors make sufficient efforts to lower their emissions. Otherwise, the sustainability of forests and forest sector will be jeopardized as forests will again be charged with the additional ambition to meet the targets by offsetting emissions from other sectors. Eustafor wishes to underline that unfortunately the carbon farming concept currently being increasingly promoted by the european commission (including via the new lulucf regulation proposal) seems to be still very ambiguous and insufficiently addresses specificities of forests and their management.

It is all the more important that these are also given equal opportunity in relation to electromobility in the amendments or additions within the draft fleet regulation in accordance with a technology-open approach.

This approach ensures a realistic view of all technologies in the sense of genuine openness to technology instead of distorting the co2 emissions of the various types of drive. From this point of view, synthetic fuels are also considered to be climate-neutral because their use only releases as much co2 as was previously extracted from the air during production.

In fact, as demonstrated by the withdrawal of the proposal to amend directive 98/71, relating to the introduction in each member country of the so-called repairs clause (currently present in only 11 member states), a definitive solution has never been found, so much so that, today, the topic of the repair clause itself finds new attention. And this because the failure to adopt a uniform regime within the union, determines the persistence of substantial obstacles to the competitiveness of independent manufacturers of bodywork spare parts in many important member states (france/germany), where the rights resulting from the registration of spare parts visible as designs and models, prevents independent operators the manufacture and sale of the same parts, intended for repair. The need for a precise legislative intervention aimed at eliminating the fragmentation of the visible spare parts market has already been reaffirmed in the previous economic reviews of industrial design in europe (2015) and legal review of industrial design protection in europe (2016).",6.28618665765139,0.246305418719212,2.5,0,FALSE

Environmental crime is one of the most profitable and growing crimes in the world. Because of the scale of the impact, the transboundary nature and the huge economic value it has to offenders, environmental crime has to be addressed at EU level to ensure that Member States work closely together. The revision of the Directive has been long-awaited and it is essential to support the enforcement of the Green Deal. IFAW supports the main elements of the proposal and welcomes the new obligations to foster practical implementation, such as the provision of targeted and regular training at all levels of the enforcement chain, the inclusion of provisions on the protection and involvement of environmental defenders and civil parties, and the measures to establish appropriate mechanisms for coordination and cooperation among Member States competent authorities.

In order to achieve 0. 2 ppm of residual chlorine at the end of any piping network, as clearly defined by national legislation, the minimum effective amount of residual chlorine to be injected is between 0. 5-0. 7 ppm.

Indeed this has also changed since the last review of this exemption. Changes within this landscape, partly due to the size of the global alliances and also the size of the vessels such alliances operate, have brought about a significant effect on port services. Services such as the tug sector, whose primary aim is the safety of the port infrastructure and of the vessels being assisted, have been impacted. Tug owners have to invest in larger and stronger tugs but have fewer jobs due to megaships doing lesser calls and are subject to price negotiation by alliances leading to a downward spiral of pricing. Indeed the greatest concern of eta in relation to the cber is the negotiation power that such alliances exert on port services driving service providers to have to accept lower pricing which many a time is economically unviable.",6.37588918412535,0.167487684729064,0,36.8843011083744,FALSE

Therefore, if the suggested criteria are not amended, they will fail their purpose of protecting human health and the environment. Why this is so, is detailed below: main issues of concern: 1. The suggested criteria are too narrow to be protective and are also inconsistent with identification of cmr substances. In the roadmap option 2, a substance is identified as an edc when there is a strong presumption that a substance is able to cause endocrine-mediated adverse effects. In the commission draft proposal, it needs instead to be known that a substance causes an endocrine-mediated adverse effect. Thus the burden of proof has been significantly raised.

"F2295","Summary: the european engineering industries which orgalime represents as a whole, attach considerable importance to achieving a secure cyberspace: as an industry, mainly capital goods industry, supplying technology and systems to all other industries and economic sectors. Orgalimeas members are more and more called upon to provide solutions incorporating systems and technology increasingly reliant on digital technologies. Given the wide coverage of orgalimeas industry, it is inevitable that a sectoral approach will need to be considered as a one-size-fits-all approach will not be appropriate. We therefore thank the european commission for its focus on the issue and wish to provide hereafter our first input. We feel that cybersecurity is a core policy issue, best dealt with through a wide consultation of and open, coordinated conversation with all interested stakeholders. Cybersecurity is not only a crucial prerequisite for digitisation of industry. It will also be embedded in industrial value chains and business models. Orgalime therefore requests policy makers to take a comprehensive industrial policy view and abstain from hasty regulatory measures. In particular, it is of utmost importance to firstly define the requirements against which any future scheme could be tested before debating different conformity assessment methods.
