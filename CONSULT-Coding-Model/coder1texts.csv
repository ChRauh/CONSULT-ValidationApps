In addition, it takes years until the cultivation of the varieties under real conditions has crystallized out which varieties will prevail with farmers, with horticultural companies and on the market. It normally takes 5 to 10 years for an asparagus variety to become successfully established on the market after it is launched.

Although we understand that article 42 of regulation (eu) 2016/2031 is important for protecting our environment, as dangerous pests should be dealt with, a complete prohibition of a number of trees which can contain these pests seems like an unproportional measure (art. 5(1) so. art. 5(4) teu). We believe that not all products from these trees form a risk to contain these pests, most importantly the seeds. Seeds do not host pests, since the seeds do not contain edible matter for them. As noted in paragraph 3 of the draft, the pests commonly are introduced in shrubs or trees into the eu. Therefore an outright ban of the seeds of the trees placed in the draft is unproportionate, as there is a big number of companies that depend on these trees, and therefore will have a significant negative economical impact on the agricultural industry.

The space to print the text especially on small lamps is extremely limited and the adhesion to the glass surface difficult to realize. The printed text must withstand very high temperatures (>250 oc), during a long time (in many cases longer than 20,000 hours). For these reasons there are few alternatives for lead. These materials are not compatible with the broad variety of lamp production processes (for instance halogen capsules, fluorescent lamps or high intensity discharge lamps). As manufacturers we are in an advanced state of replacing the lead in the printing inks, but we are not completely ready. We are therefore surprised to see that the category 5 for lighting in exemption 21(c) is missing.

Nonetheless, we do feel the current definition for when a platform will be regarded as a agatekeepera needs to be clarified (e. g. are users reached monthly counted as those navigating the platform or only those buying goods and services from it), and that the current classification could overlook platforms with significant power in certain industries (such as the car rental industry) since they do not have a large enough general reach to be considered a agatekeepera, despite their significant power within an individual industry. Essentially, we feel a platform has the potential to have a gatekeeper type of role within a certain industry without meeting the criteria and metrics used to define them as such under the current digital markets act proposal, and that this possibility should be addressed, possibly through broadening the scope of which entities meet the criteria to be defined as a agatekeepera or setting a second tier of obligations for players with a significant market power.",6.5833311559767,0.23828125,1,2.19043750000003,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"F465068","We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the roadmap of the inception impact assessment and to inform the initiative on migration limits for lead, cadmium and possibly other metals from ceramic and vitreous food contact materials. Key points are highlighted below and focus on the fact that it will only be possible for industry and the commission to evaluate the impact of proposed regulatory changes if there is clarity on: i. The inclusion of different metals and their associated limitsa. The term aheavy metala is not defined and the roadmap fails to clearly recognise the difference between metals that are present as trace elements in raw materials, those that are added for technical reasons and those that are decorative. The reasons for the use of different metal compounds needs to be clearly understood as this will have implications for how they can be controlled. Currently the document is confused in places about the presence / use of metals. b. Clarity is required about which metal species may be deemed hazardous, the science behind these conclusions and how this is applicable to ceramics. It should be noted that many pigments are not classed as hazardous; for e. g. stable engineered cadmium pigments.",6.57230565835755,0.124378109452736,0.125,37.3868563432836,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"F7748","For our feedback on the roadmap and recommendations for the strategy, please see the attached document. Pax welcomes this roadmap on elements for a european union strategy for engagement with iraq, and the longer-term approach that the eu intends to take in terms of stabilisation, reconstruction and reconciliation in iraq post-isis. The roadmap recognises and addresses the multiple factors driving the various conflicts and looks at ways to support the country in addressing these issues. This analysis confirms that stabilization efforts in iraq should not mean a return to the status quo which has led to the rise of isis, but aim at policy changes addressing root causes of conflict. Pax also values the structured and consultative process in which the eu has developed this roadmap and is developing the strategy, in particular in engagement with iraqi civil society. Commitment to a strong and long-term support and participation of iraqi civil society in strategic policy development is vital for contributing to a just and sustainable peace and security in iraq. Pax encourages the eu and its member states to take note of below recommendations in developing the eu-iraq strategy. These recommendations are critical in order to help break the continuous cycle of violence in iraq, to address root causes of conflict, and to ensure inclusion of all communities in developing sustainable and resilient recovery, reconstruction and governance.",6.55356529182809,0.173160173160173,1.25,23.3424594155844,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
