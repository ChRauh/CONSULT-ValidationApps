# Project:  COMM consult
# Task:     Draw text samples for human coding / validation
# Author:   @ChRauh (10.09.2025)
############################################################



# Context / setup ####

# We need to validate our text-based measures for 'information quality' of consultation responses
# against the assessments of human coders.

# Coding full texts is not possible - text length varies drastically and can span several pages of text
# We thus agreed to let them code shorter units (3-4 sentences)

# As we have no consistent formatting markers in the text data (such as paragraphs or line breaks),
# we decided to take the first few sentences of each contribution (typically containing the key messages)
# of consultation responses.
# In this context, we want to exclude the first sentence, as  this often just informs about who the responder is.

# We are able to hire three human coders who can code around ~ 600 units (based on testing coding for units of 3-4 sentences length)

# We want to assess intercoder reliability as well, requiring us to generat an overlap sample seen by all coders,
# meaning the targeted samples are the following:

# One 'overlap' sample of 100 text snippets (contained in all sets)
# Three seperate/distinct samples of 500 text snippets (one for each coder)

# To get a valid measure while maximising variation across our measures, we go for stratified random samples.
# The relevant strata are:

# Quintiles of the text based measures (Flesch reading ease, named entities, legal language - calculated for all text snippets before sampling)
# Type of legislative procedure the Comm consults on (as this is the key analytical dimension in the analysis, var: policy_stage_short with three values)



# Work plan ####

# 1. Load full text data and extract text snippets
# 2. (Re-) Calculate text measures for the snippets
# 3. Draw the four stratified random samples (avoid duplicates across samples to maximise number of obs)
# 4. Build and store three samples to be fed into the coding app (unique id, keep measure values, mark overlap obs)

# The first sentence almost always introduces the sender of the feedback - we do not want this in the data the humans will see

# Helper function
# We want the human coders to see meaningful text (= full setences), while avoid overly long comments
